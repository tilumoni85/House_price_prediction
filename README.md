# House_price_prediction

# Objective:

### Developed a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other property characteristics.

# Process:

### Performed extensive data cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct outliers.
### Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and house prices.
### Applied feature engineering techniques, such as creating interaction terms and converting categorical variables into dummy variables, to improve model performance.
### Built a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices based on selected features.
### Employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most significant predictors of house prices.
### Split the data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
### Achieved an R-squared value of .59 on the test set, explaining 59% of the variance in house prices.

## Tools & Technologies Used:

### Python, Pandas, and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
### Scikit-learn for model development, feature selection, and evaluation.
### Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and EDA.
